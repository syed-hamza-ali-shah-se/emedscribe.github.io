        <h1>Privacy Policy for e-MedScribe</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 7, 2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using e-MedScribe. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information necessary to provide our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Authentication Information:</strong> When you log in using your Microsoft account, we receive your name and email address from Microsoft to identify you and secure your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Patient Health Information (PHI):</strong> When you activate the e-MedScribe extension on a PointClickCare (PCC) webpage, the extension reads clinical data from that page. This data may include patient allergies, medications, vitals, lab results, diagnoses, and clinical documents. This data is processed <strong>only</strong> when you choose to generate a note.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you purchase credits, your payment is processed by our third-party payment processor (Stripe). We do not store your credit card details. We only receive a confirmation of payment and your user identifier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your information is used for the sole purpose of operating the e-MedScribe service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Authenticate You:</strong> We use your account information to log you in and manage your access.</li>
            <li><strong>To Generate Clinical Notes:</strong> The patient data read from PCC is sent securely to our backend (hosted on Microsoft Azure, a HIPAA-compliant service) where our AI model processes it to generate a structured clinical note.</li>
            <li><strong>To Manage Your Account:</strong> We use your information to manage your credit balance and note history.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage, Security, and Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal or patient data to third parties.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> All data transmitted between the e-MedScribe extension and our backend is encrypted using HTTPS.</li>
            <li><strong>Patient Data Handling:</strong> Patient data read from PCC is processed in memory. We <strong>do not</strong> permanently store this raw, scraped patient data on our servers after your note has been successfully generated and delivered to you. The final, generated note <em>is</em> stored as part of your user account history so you can access it later.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Our servers are hosted on Microsoft Azure, which provides robust physical and network security.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment:</strong> All payments are handled by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. To do so, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <strong>support@emedscribe.com</strong></p>
